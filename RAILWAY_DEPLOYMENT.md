## Alternative: Deploy via Railway Dashboard

1. **Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Create New Project**
3. **Connect GitHub Repository** (if using git)
4. **Upload Files** manually:
   - `bot3.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `railway.json`
   - `credentials/` folder
5. **Set Environment Variables** in the dashboard
6. **Deploy**

## Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard

Set these in your Railway project settings:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Your Telegram bot token |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key |
| `ADMIN_ID` | Your Telegram user ID |
| `BOT_USERNAME` | Your bot's username |
| `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` | `./credentials/sturdy-lead-454406-n3-16c47cb3a35a.json` |

## Monitoring Your Bot

```bash
# View real-time logs
railway logs --follow

# Check deployment status
railway status

# Restart bot if needed
railway service restart
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Failures**: Check `requirements.txt` and Python version
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Credentials**: Verify Google Cloud credentials are uploaded
4. **Bot Token**: Confirm bot token is correct

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check Railway project info
railway whoami
railway projects

# View detailed logs
railway logs --tail 100
